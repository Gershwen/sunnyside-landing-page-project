## My process

Mobile first design using grid and flexbox. I used a little bit of JavaScript for the hamburger toggle button and to switch between active states on the navbar links.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- jQuery

### What I learned

I learned to rely on percentage instead of fixed pixels to add responsive padding and margins. 
This made the webpage adjust smoother to the viewport.
